# Katzlab-Code
Bioinformatics based code written while working in Laura Katz's microbial evolution and diversity lab.

While in the lab, I worked on a variety of projects, including:
1. **Using Maxent to predict the ecological niches of Arcellinida**
2. **Creating a tool that visualized transcriptomic data from ciliate genomes**
3. **Phylogenomic analysis of genes associated with meiosis/ploidy**
4. **Assisting with various data/server maintenance tasts**
5. **Teaching other lab member to code basic graphs in R**
6. **Automating a pipeline to analyze single nucleotide polymorphisms**
